✅ **Next steps:**  
- Replace `YOUR_LIVE_LINK_HERE` with your deployed app URL (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.).  
- Replace `YOUR_UI_IMAGE_LINK_HERE` with an image of your app UI (you can host it in `/frontend/public` or on Imgur).  
- Replace `YOUR_REPO_LINK_HERE` with your GitHub repository URL.

If you want, I can **also make a visually enhanced README** with badges for technologies, license, and GitHub stars—it will look professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that version too?
